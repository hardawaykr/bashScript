# bashScript
Web based utility for easily creating aliases in bash. The goal is to simplify
the creation of bash alias and other shortcuts stored in the ~/.bash_profile file
on unix file systems. Eventually I hope to host the application online where
users will be able to use a gui to intuitively create shortcuts for the creation
of bash commands.
