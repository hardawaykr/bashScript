What is my goal for the project?
    What do I want it to accomplish?
    Make it easier for users to create bash commands
    bash command search tool?
        Google is better.
        What do I offer over that?
        Ability to automatically download bash_profile?
        I don't know if this is a good idea.
        I could also design my chess game.
        Let's build a chess game in javascript.
